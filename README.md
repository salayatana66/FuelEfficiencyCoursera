## Overview

This is the code I used for an analysis of the fuel-efficiency of automatic vs manual
transmissions, using the `mtcars` dataset for 
for the Coursera class "Regression Models" (part of the JHU Data Science Specialization).

On my version of R (3.2.0) to produce the pdf file I needed to use `knit2html` in the R console and then
`pandoc project2.md -o project2.pdf` in the shell.
